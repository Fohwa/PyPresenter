# PyPresenter
Presentation Software for lyrics in Pygame

## why another branch
this is an attemt to rectify the project.
Previous main went out of control, did not work.
way to complex, things changed and the original design could not hold up.
So this is the new and improved version of PyPresenter.
The main difference is that now there is a seperate instance of a server, from my socket template on Github.
Making it easier and robuster to handle communication.

## TODO
The features from PyPresenter need to be implemented in this version

- changing Resolution
- better interface for operator, no keywords and more features (see old operator.py)
  - change resolution from operator
  - address individual clients
  - remove prefix
- make interface for operator better than the previous one
  - gui?
  - slide mode
  - image mode
  - video?
  - motion background?
  - sound?
- screen with multiple templates
  - we need more than just one mode (slide mode)
  - variable text lenght
  - changable background
